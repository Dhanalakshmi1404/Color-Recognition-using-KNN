The training data has a huge important in classification accuracy.

Another important thing is lightning and shadows. In my test images, the images which were taken under bad lighting conditions and with shadows are classified wrong (false positives), maybe some filtering algorithm should/can be implemented before the test images send to KNN classifier Thus, accuracy can be improved.
